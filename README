Requirements:
Java SDK 1.6 or compatible
Eclipse 3.7 classic with CDT & GIT

Usage:
1. Checkout the code
2. Import the project (there is one currently)
3. Run a sample launch configuration


Things still to do:
1. Automatically create eclipse.desktop file
2. Installable feature - so you could install a feature and enjoy full Unity integration.
